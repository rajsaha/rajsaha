# Hello there! I'm Raj 👋🏾

I'm a Full-Stack Developer living in Malaysia and I'm currently working for [**Snappymob**](https://www.snappymob.com/).

**😎 I know a fair bit of**

* Angular
* Node
* Mongo

**🤓 I know a little bit of**

* Vue
* Nest
* Postgres

**🤡 I know a lot of nothing.**

**My Side Projects**

* 🏔 Everest: This is a social-network / resource aggregator that I made. In a nutshell, is Pinterest married with Instagram. Sadly, it is no longer in development.
* [**💳 idontwannalogtime**](https://idontwannalogtime-frontend.web.app/): A time logger I made for myself (and use daily!). It is in active development.

**What I do outside of software engineering**

I make music sometimes. You can find my stuff on [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmO2-0zBQhcXXjPcLEfk-Iw). I'm also in a band called Changing Homes! We're on [**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5M1zRN28GLSDh7B4aJzNLg?si=lLlskI7pS0qkhP_cLJ6c0w). These days I mostly just listen though. Here's my own [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7GjnOugRI1sn18kGKn1o4D?si=Q8orE6YhS4ug3tsCnSrOFQ). If you're into metal, you'll love a lot of the stuff on there.

I'm also very much into gaming. There's nothing like a good single player to end the day with!
